This bug occurs when using the Expo Constants module to access device-specific information. The issue arises when trying to access properties that are not available on certain platforms or simulators. For example, trying to access `Constants.deviceName` on a simulator or web environment may result in an error or unexpected behavior. This could manifest as an app crash, incorrect data being presented, or unexpected functionality.
